        Jax Wong stems from San Francisco, but they also consider Hong Kong home, while currently residing in New York City. They are the protector of their spirit, considering any and all types of love and enjoyment sacred.  Wong remains a guardian of their happiness. 
        <br> <br>
        Wong exists as a designer and engineer. The definition of the job is to solve problems with logic. Their work is often visually simple due to a utilitarian design process, honest and dynamic. Wongâ€™s work is like their hair, everchanging yet so very vital to understanding them. They work in an iterative design process, taking things step by step and constantly asking themself what else is needed to elevate the experience. More than principles, Wong has guiding questions that they deeply value in relation to their work: how useful an element of the design is, what purpose said element serves, et cetera. Wong draws inspiration from multiple sources of work that they admire, or find on the streets on their way to somewhere.

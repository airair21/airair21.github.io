        <h2>
            Incentivized Reading
        </h2>
        <p>
            2024
        </p>
        <p>
            I had been following my line of research and experiments for my thesis, which was about happiness. 
            My way to get through life is <span style="font-style: italic;">"I do not keep going to be happy, I am happy <span style="font-style: normal;"> so that </span>I can keep going." </span>
            
            <br>
            At the time, I was taking an Accounting Fundamentals course, but for the life of me could not read through the textbook. 
            I thought, with the fuel of happiness (and the change in typography) I could finally get myself to read the text.     
        </p>



        <div class="fwgrid">
            <video width="100%" height="100%" autoplay loop controls>
                <source src="ir/flipthru.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                <!-- <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg"> -->
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
        </div>

        <p>
            I tried different modes of happiness, which can be see through the incentives to read the text. 
            In each of the chapter was both a different mode of incentive and a different typography usecase. 
            <br><br>
            The first chapter had the standard full-page-width textbox, but I changed the font to try and keep it more engaging. 
            At the end of the chapter was a snack pack, as a post-activity incentive. 
            <br><br>
            Chapter two was so long it was split into two parts, but the same methodology applies to both sections. 
            A more narrow text-column, and a persistent visual incentive was utlized, as well as a way to check my progress through the section. 
            In section one, there is an image of a happy dog on every spread, (hopefully) giving me joy and making life just slightly more pleasant as I read. 
            In section two, images of dogs were replaced with pictures from my favorite manga/anime, encouraging me to finish reading so I can watch it. 
            <br><br>
            In chapter three, the format was inspired by a newspaper, with two narrow columns per page. Another persistent incentive was used, but this time it was a candy that you could eat every single time you flipped the page.
